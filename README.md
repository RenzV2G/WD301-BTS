Language used and frameworks: Angular, material, and bootstrap, mongodb

Discussion:

  The Breaking the Silence website is about sharing thoughts and experiences
from people who have traumatic experiences and unhealthy mental health and how
will they overcome this. With the freedom wall this is where the component 
freedom-wall will display or post the user's shared story or composed story.
The user can compose their story from our Compose page or component, by using 
mongoDb as our API to post the composed story by the user to the freedom wall page
or freedom-wall component. We used bootstrap and material framework to design the 
website with their helpful tools they provide and we will utilize these frameworks
to achieve the mockup interface that we have created.
